How to mount and run CBFS:
===========================
- get current snapshot of fuse python bindings: 
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@fuse.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fuse co -P python
- call python setup.py to compile fuse-python
- copy stuff in build/lib.linux-i686-2.5 to cbfs storeclient directory
- mount in debug mode: python cbfs.py /mnt/mnt -d -f -s

Implementation Info:
======================
- chunks are stored by sha-512 ids
- important to remember: chunks are *never* rewritten, as their hash changes then

storage of files inside chunks (not yet realized in implementation):
 - it is assumed that all chunks but the first and the last (which are usually "shared chunks") are fully used by current file
 - first and last chunk has index and length of part that is used by file
 - if data is changed, *always* new chunks are created
 - when file is closed, last chunk is analyzed if it can be shared by several files (see CBFSDirtree.unfilledchunks)
 - only unshared chunks may be written to (when file is closed, last chunk will be shared with other files nevertheless) <-- change!
