How to mount and run CBFS:
===========================
- get current snapshot of fuse python bindings: 
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@fuse.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fuse co -P python
- call python setup.py to compile fuse-python
- copy stuff in build/lib.linux-i686-2.5 to cbfs storeclient directory
- mount in debug mode: python cbfs.py /mnt/mnt -d -f -s

Implementation Info:
======================
- chunks are stored by sha-512 ids
- important to remember: chunks are *never* rewritten, as their hash changes then
