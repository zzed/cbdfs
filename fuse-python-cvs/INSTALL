REQUIREMENTS:
 - FUSE 2.* (tested with FUSE 2.3 and newer)
 - In general, Python 2.3 or newer.
   Version specific notes:
   - 2.4: this is the version the code is developed with, so you can
     expect this one to work the most smoothly. 
   - 2.3: in general, it seems to be useable. However, the optparse 
     module of Python 2.3 is out of date. This doesn't have fatal
     consequences, but if you want nice help optput / version info,
     you should either use optparse.py from 2.4 or install a recent
     version of Optik (http://optik.sourceforge.net) (and adjust the
     respective import statements to use optik instead of optparse).
   - 2.2: With some minor adjustments / additional imports it should
     be useable, too. If not else, you'll need to install Optik (see
     previous item) and add some "from __future__ import generators"
     statements.
 - pkg-config [http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/]

 Additional info about the Python requirement.
INSTALLATION:
The best way to install this python FUSE module is:
 1. Type 'python setup.py build'. (If you have FUSE installed at a
    non-standard location, adjust the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
    accordingly.)
 2. You might try the example filesystems under example/. Eg., see what
    "python example/xmp.py -h" gives.
 3. If all has gone ok, become root and type 'python setup.py install'.

That way, the FUSE python modules will be built against the correct version
of python and installed in your system-wide python directory. This will allow
your filesystem script to find them, no matter where it's residing.

WARNING:
We have altered from the original FUSE Python API in non-compatible
ways. See README.new_fusepy_api how can you get running a fs which is
written against the original API.
