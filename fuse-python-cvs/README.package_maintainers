The API of the Python binding has changed with fuse-python 0.2-pre1.
Therefore older fuse-python based filesystems *won't work* out of the box
with fuse-python 0.2-pre1.

However, no need to worry. Just read the *Old API/Enforcing compatibility*
section of ``README.new_fusepy_api`` and you will know how to deal with the
situation.
